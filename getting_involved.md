Thank you for your interest in our research! See below for how you can get
involved. This information is accurate as of **November 2023**.

If you have additional questions after reading the below and want to get involved, feel free to email me. 
My contact information is [available on my website](https://danielseita.github.io/).
Depending on the volume of email, I may be slow to respond. 
I encourage you to read [Yonatan Bisk's FAQ](https://yonatanbisk.com/emailing_professors.html) about emailing professors. 
I will try to respond to emails that are tailored to me to some extent. 
I kindly ask that you not send the same generic email to a long list of professors.

## PhD Students

*I am expecting to hire about 3 PhD students to start in Fall 2024*. Please 
apply to USC for a PhD program and indicate my name in your application. My
home department is [computer science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/), though I am
open to co-advising students from other departments (as well as co-advising
within computer science). There is no need to email me as part of this
application process, since I need to see the full application (which includes
confidential letters of recommendation). Nonetheless, you are welcome to email
me if you feel like our research interests are especially aligned. I will make
sure to carefully check applications which list my name as a potential PhD
advisor. Please also check out my [advising statement](#advising-statement).

I just joined USC in Fall 2023 and am excited to be starting a new lab. I am
especially interested in hiring students with the following experience, skills,
or criteria:

- who have significant experience in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and
  vision-language (foundation) models.
- who have built, fixed, and engineered robotics hardware.
- who have implemented robotics or physics simulators.
- who have applied robotics to fields such as agriculture and health care.
- who come from underrepresented, non-traditional, and/or low-income
backgrounds, but who have reasonably "maxed out" their available resources to
learn about robotics and machine learning.

I think this is a great time to be working in robotics. We have a wonderful (and
growing) [robotics group at USC][3]. Furthermore, the computer science
department will have a [brand new building][4] ready in 2024 for us!

PhD students will receive funding. The normal requirement is to TA for two
semesters. Beyond those two semesters, I will do my best to support you with as
much research funding as I can.

If you are a PhD student already at USC and interested in collaborating with me,
feel free to email me to schedule a time to chat. To reduce back-and-forth
emails, please clearly indicate *what* you would like to discuss and a *range*
of available times.

## Masters and Undergraduate Students at USC

Please fill out [the following application][1].
We will reach out to you if we decide to interview you.

## Postdocs

I am not actively searching for postdocs. However, if you feel like there's a
good match and that there might be opportunities to get funding, I am happy to
consider options.

## External Visitors not at USC

I may eventually be able to work with external visitors who are not currently
at USC, but I expect this to be a very rare circumstance.


## Advising Statement

Here is my brief perspective on advising.

- I want to work on high-impact problems in robotics, and especially robotic
  manipulation. Whenever possible, projects and/or papers should show *many*
  real world examples of a robot adjusting its environment (including successes
  *and* failures). I am less interested in projects which eke out small
  improvements on benchmarks. 
- For presenting research, our target conferences are ICRA, IROS, RSS, and
  CoRL, though we will consider other venues as appropriate (such as machine
  learning conferences).
- Unless we are legally forbidden from doing so, all papers/projects will have
  code, data, and other supplementary material available to help with
  reproducing results.
- I am a very hands-on advisor who actively works closely with all lab members.
  I am available for regular or impromptu in-person meetings, and am available
  on the lab's Slack for additional communication.
- I want my students to be successful and will support academic, industry, or
  other career paths. I will regularly discuss with students about how to
  facilitate their career growth. I encourage PhD students to have 1-3
  internships at top industry labs.
- I will follow a code of conduct which includes an anti-harassment policy.
  I share the policy with lab members and ask that they follow it as well. As
  per the policy, if you meet with me, you can expect me to conduct myself
  professionally in our interactions both within the lab and outside of it.
- Students should feel welcomed to challenge me. If a lab policy is not working,
  or if my research suggestion does not make sense, say so.

If this all sounds good, please apply to work with me!
