Thank you for your interest in our research! See below for how you can get
involved. This information is accurate as of **August 2023**.

If you have additional questions after reading the below and want to get
involved, feel free to email me. Depending on the volume of email, I may be slow
to respond. I encourage you to read [Yonatan Bisk's FAQ](https://yonatanbisk.com/emailing_professors.html)
about emailing professors. 

My contact information is [available on my website](https://danielseita.github.io/).

## PhD Students

I am expecting to hire around 3-4 PhD students to start in Fall 2024. Please apply
to USC for a PhD program and indicate my name in your application. My home
department is [computer science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/), though I am open to
co-advising students from other departments. There is no need to email me as
part of this application process. I will make sure to carefully check
applications which list my name as a potential PhD advisor.

If you are a PhD student already at USC and interested in collaborating with me
in any capacity, feel free to email me to schedule a time to chat. To reduce
back-and-forth emails, please clearly indicate *what* you would like to discuss
and a *range* of available times.

## Masters and Undergraduate Students at USC

Please fill out
[the following application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0GzWxX3vGoNFGGHwIk-2SjCAO6npQzN7WsVJjaUfymiEDiA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Postdocs

I am not actively searching for postdocs. However, if you feel like there's a
good match and that there might be opportunities to get funding, I am happy to
consider options.

## External Visitors not at USC

I may be able to eventually support visiting students or potential internships
from students not currently at USC. However, I am prioritizing collaborations
with people who are already at USC.
